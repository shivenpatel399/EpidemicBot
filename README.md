# Epidemic ID Bot

This is a bot that helps with practicing the Disease Detectives event in Science Olympiad. This bot is different from the other bots (listed in "Some of my other creations") because not only it has identification of
different microbes but you also can practice epidemiological vocabulary, identify study biases, and practice information about foodborne diseases listed by the Food and Drug Association (FDA)

## Manual

This bot is special because it uses slash commands. When using this bot, do / and press on the bot icon so you can see the whole slash manual.
